# 👋 Hello there!

I'm building small, meaningful web tools that make daily life smoother — from group decision apps to internal workflow systems. Most of my work is open-source, lightweight, and powered by curiosity. I work at the intersection of **digital health**, **automation**, and **practical creativity**.
